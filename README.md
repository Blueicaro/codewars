# codewars

This repository contains codewars exercises written in free pascal.

***

My favorite language has always been pascal. In my work, whenever I had to make a tool, I did it in this language.

Recently I have had to start working on other languages.

To practice these new languages, I signed up for "CodeWars", where you can do many exercises of many different types in many languages.

Reviewing the available languages, Free Pascal wasn't there, so I decided to create this repository where I'll put the exercises I do in other languages, as well as their version in free pascal.

The motivation to write the exercises also in free pascal is just for fun
